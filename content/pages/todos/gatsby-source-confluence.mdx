# Gatsby-Source-Confluence (https://www.gatsbyjs.cn/packages/gatsby-source-confluence/#gatsby-source-confluence)

A quick and dirty Gatsby source plugin for retrieving data from everybody’s least favourite content editor, Confluence.

An example site is available on Netlify(https://gatsby-source-confluence.netlify.com/)


## Installation

<code>
npm i --save gatsby-source-confluence
</code>

## Usage

Add the following to your gatsby-config.js file:

<code>
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-plugin-react-helmet",
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-confluence",
      options: {
        hostname: "companyname.atlassian.net",
        auth: "Basic XXX...",
        cql: "ancestor = 534095277",
        limit: 10
      }
    }
  ]
};
</code>
## Please ensure that the following parameters are set:

* hostname (Required): the Confluence base URL to use for all requests
* auth: Your username.password base64 encoded with a Basic prefix. Please don’t check this in to source control ;)
* cql (Required): a CQL expression to filter out a list of documents
* limit: Defaults to 10. Please set this to the maximum number of documents to load in.

## Known issues
* Confluence storage often has macros embedded. Macros not handled.
* Only handles pages, not blog posts
* No page tree hierarchy (I told you this was rough!)
* Pull requests welcome!
